# Courses Calculator

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that facilitates the process of calculating the advised
course length range for an orienting course.

The ideal range is determined by analyzing the results of selected stages from prior events. Such results are
fetched from [OriOasis](https://www.orioasis.pt).

Another main goal is to learn new technologies and frameworks during the development of this project.

The end goal would be to deploy the application on a cloud platform and automate the most as possible that process.
