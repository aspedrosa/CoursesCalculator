# Courses Calculator

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that facilitates the process of calculating the advised
course length range for an orienting course.

The ideal range is determined by analyzing the results of selected stages from prior events. Such results are
fetched from [OriOasis](https://www.orioasis.pt).
